# Adoption stream — 2026-08-16

Findings raised by Michal while preparing to publish AART inside the company. They are **not** from
a live acceptance walk. They come from the reader's side: someone who has never run `aart` meeting
the documents and the first commands.

**These take priority over the register's open rows, including when they are cosmetic.** A finding
here is not competing with `LAF-15` on severity. It is competing on a different question — whether
the first hour with AART is pleasant enough that there is a second one. Adoption is the goal of this
stream and polish is the work.

Rules for this stream, same as every other:

- One id per finding, allocated here, `AD-nn`, never reused and never renumbered.
- Every id gets a row in [`residue-register.md`](residue-register.md), which stays the single place
  that says what is open. This file says where the finding came from; the register says its state.
- Nothing is repaired in the same pass that records it.

## Findings

| ID | Severity | Raised | What was seen |
|---|---|---|---|
| `AD-01` | low | `2026-08-16` | The Quick start offers exactly one way to install AART, and it is a developer's way: `python -m pip install --no-index --no-deps --no-build-isolation -e /path/to/agent-artifacts`. A colleague who wants to *use* the tool has to clone the repository first, and then holds an editable install pointing at a checkout they will forget they are on. `pipx` and `uv` are how a Python CLI is installed today, and neither appears. Asked for: `pipx` and `uv` beside the `pip` line, **and the sources an installer can actually name** — a wheel already on disk, a wheel fetched from a GitHub release, and the repository URL directly — not only a path to a clone. Widened by the raiser the same day. |
| `AD-02` | medium | `2026-08-16` | The README never says what vendoring is. The word *vendor* does not occur in it — zero times in 219 lines — while `registry vendor` and `registry revendor` are shipped commands, `provenance.json` is a shipped document, and two designs exist for the mechanism. *Maintaining a registry* teaches `promote-native` instead, and `promote-native` is the one that requires the upstream repository to already declare `aart-source.json` — the precondition most repositories cannot meet, and the exact barrier vendoring was built to remove. A maintainer reading only the README concludes AART cannot take content from a repository that knows nothing about AART. Asked for: an explanation of vendoring in the README. |

## Notes on `AD-01`

The finding is filed as `low` because nothing is broken. It is at the top of this stream anyway,
because it is the first code block a colleague meets.

**The ask is two-dimensional, and that is what makes it more than a missing line.** There is the
installer — `pip`, `pipx`, `uv` — and there is what it is pointed at. The README covers one cell of
that grid, and it is the cell a colleague adopting AART is least likely to be in:

| Pointed at | Covered today |
|---|---|
| a local clone, editable | **yes** — the only line there is |
| a wheel already downloaded | no |
| a wheel on a GitHub release | no |
| the repository URL, no clone | no |

The three empty rows are the ones that matter for adoption, because none of them needs a checkout.
`v2.6.1` published a wheel and the repository is public, so all three are reachable today.

Four things to settle when it is fixed, not now:

1. **Every command in the README must have been run.** An install line that does not work is worse
   than an absent one — it is the first thing a colleague tries and the first thing that fails.
   Candidate commands are drafted below and **none of them has been executed**; the fix walks each
   one in a throwaway environment and the README carries only what passed.
2. **Which host the URL names.** The public repository is one thing; a company install may point at
   an internal mirror or GHE, where `pipx install git+https://…` needs credentials AART itself never
   handles. The README should show the shape and say plainly where the host goes.
3. **Whether a version is pinned.** `git+https://…@v2.6.1` gives a colleague a known executable;
   the bare URL gives them whatever `main` is that morning. For adoption the tag is almost certainly
   right, and then the README has a version number in it that has to be maintained.
4. **Whether the editable line stays.** It is the right line for someone hacking on AART and the
   wrong one for someone adopting it. The likely shape is two labelled blocks — *install it* and
   *work on it* — rather than a row of commands with no explanation of which is which.

### Candidate commands — drafted, not verified

Recorded so the fix starts from a list rather than a blank page. Each is a claim to be tested, not a
result.

```sh
# from a wheel already on disk
pipx install ./agent_artifacts-2.6.1-py3-none-any.whl
uv tool install ./agent_artifacts-2.6.1-py3-none-any.whl
python -m pip install ./agent_artifacts-2.6.1-py3-none-any.whl

# from a wheel on the GitHub release, without downloading it first
pipx install https://github.com/M1F1/agent-artifacts/releases/download/v2.6.1/agent_artifacts-2.6.1-py3-none-any.whl

# from the repository, no clone
pipx install "git+https://github.com/M1F1/agent-artifacts@v2.6.1"
uv tool install "git+https://github.com/M1F1/agent-artifacts@v2.6.1"
```

Two properties AART has that make these unusually safe to recommend, and that the fixed README
should probably say out loud: there are **no runtime dependencies**, so nothing is resolved from an
index at install time, and the published wheel is **byte-reproducible from the tag** with its digest
in the release notes — so a colleague who wants to check what they installed can.

## Notes on `AD-02`

`medium`, not cosmetic. This one hides a capability rather than presenting it awkwardly: the
README's *Maintaining a registry* section documents `promote-native` and stops, and the sentence
under it — *keeps reviewed subscriptions and updates easy without adapting a foreign legacy layout*
— reads as though that command already solves the foreign-repository case. It does not. It refuses
any upstream without `aart-source.json`.

The material to write from already exists and does not need inventing:
[`DESIGN-registry-vendoring.md`](../design/DESIGN-registry-vendoring.md) opens with the barrier and
what removes it, and [`DESIGN-vendored-copy-integrity.md`](../design/DESIGN-vendored-copy-integrity.md)
covers what keeps a copy honest afterwards.

Three things to settle when it is fixed, not now:

1. **Where it goes.** Beside `promote-native` under *Maintaining a registry*, or its own section.
   The two commands answer the same question with different preconditions, so a reader meeting one
   without the other is the defect; whatever shape is chosen has to put the choice in front of them.
2. **What the explanation has to contain.** At minimum: it copies the content into your registry, it
   records where the copy came from in `provenance.json`, `revendor` is how it is refreshed when
   upstream moves, and the copy is checked for drift. Anything less and a maintainer cannot tell
   vendoring from copy-and-paste.
3. **Whether the `promote-native` sentence is corrected at the same time.** It is currently the only
   thing the README says about foreign content, and it overstates its reach.
